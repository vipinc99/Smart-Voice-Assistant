According to WHO reports, at least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from vision impairment.
Currently, with a lot of technological breakthroughs coming out regularly, the need for independent
living is recognized in the situation of these 2.2 billion visually impaired people who are socially
restricted. They encounter various occasions in their daily lives where they are in an unfamiliar
environment and are unable to aid themselves. For them, the only way out may be to trust a random
stranger who isn't necessarily reliable.

As a result, we intend to use technological advancements to assist visually impaired persons. For this
purpose, we propose developing a system that uses Artificial Intelligence, Image Recognition,
Machine Learning, etc, which will assist them in interacting with their surroundings. In simple words,
the basic idea behind our system is to turn visual data into an alternate modality suitable for blind users and we intend to use Artificial Intelligence for this conversion.
